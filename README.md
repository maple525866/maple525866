# 🤓Hello, I'm maple
Hello, I am maple, a sophomore student studying computer science and technology👻

I hope to become a senior software developer and keep working hard🤠

Currently studying Nacos, Seata, RocketMQ, Dubbo, Grpc and other microservice development technologies🥱

I am currently passionate about open source and am currently studying the connection between modules in Seata

I am currently studying Tencent Kona JDK17, about using JNI to call OpenSSL to accelerate various interfaces, while taking into account pure Java implementation

# 🛠️Technology Stack
Java、Go、Git、Sql、Lua...

Mysql、Redis、Spring、SpringBoot、Dubbo...

Nacos、Seata、RocketMQ、Kafka ...

Docker、Kubernetes、Github Actions......
