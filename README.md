# 🤓Hello, I'm maple
Hello, I am maple, a junior student majoring in Computer Science and Technology👻

I hope to become a senior software developer and keep working hard🤠

Currently studying Nacos, Seata, RocketMQ, Dubbo, Grpc and other microservice development technologies🥱

I am currently researching compatibility issues between Seata and Oracle databases.

I am currently studying Tencent Kona JDK17, about using JNI to call OpenSSL to accelerate various interfaces, while taking into account pure Java implementation

# 🛠️Technology Stack
Java、Go、Git、Sql、Lua...

Mysql、Redis、Spring、SpringBoot、Dubbo...

Nacos、Seata、RocketMQ、Kafka ...

Docker、Kubernetes、Github Actions......
