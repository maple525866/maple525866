# 🤓Hello, I'm maple
Hello, I am maple, a junior student majoring in Computer Science and Technology👻

I hope to become a senior software developer and keep working hard🤠

Currently studying Nacos, Seata, RocketMQ, Dubbo, Grpc and other microservice development technologies🥱

I am currently very interested in Spring AI Alibaba and am learning about its concepts and technologies.

I don't believe there's anything others can do that I can't. I will keep moving forward until I reach my goal.

# 🛠️Technology Stack
Java、Go、Git、Sql、Lua...

Spring、SpringBoot、Spring AI、Langchain4j...

Mysql、Oracle、Redis、Dubbo、Grpc...

Nacos、Apollo、Seata、RocketMQ、Kafka ...

Docker、Kubernetes、Github Actions......
