# 🤓Hello, I'm maple
Hello, I am maple, a junior student majoring in Computer Science and Technology👻

I hope to become a senior software developer and keep working hard🤠

I am currently very interested in Spring AI Alibaba and am learning about its concepts and technologies.

I don't believe there's anything others can do that I can't. I will keep moving forward until I reach my goal.
